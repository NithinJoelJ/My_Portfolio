                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>Outside of my technical interests, I have a deep passion for various creative pursuits. Photography is something I love, as it allows me to capture moments and express my perspective through visuals. I often experiment with different styles, lighting, and compositions to develop my skills. Video editing is another area where I can merge my technical and artistic sides, bringing stories to life through editing techniques, effects, and sound design.</p>
